# mscthesis

This project contains the code for my Master's Thesis in Computer Science at ITU, titled "Advanced Feature Engineering for AI Text Detection". 
- 'src' contains folders 'llm' and 'feature', which detail the LLM and feature-based approaches used in the thesis
- 'data' contains all the figures, datasets and metrics used in the thesis. However, some files are very large, so they are excluded from Git. You may need to run some code to generate them, or you can contact me for the data (kasper.knudsen@gmail.com)
